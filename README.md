# NPC-generator
End of marking period python project
# 📄 How to write a good README


## 🌟 Highlights


Here are the main highlights of this code:

- You can input your own character's names
- Customization of characters
- Random medieval jobs
- Not everything is randomized


## ℹ️ Overview

The purpose of this project is to make a code that randomly generates 10 distinct non-playable characters (npcs). The user can input their own choices or randomly pick them. Each character is distinct and unique with randomized character attributes. Some characters may not qualify for certain attributes, depending on the user's input. Each character has a name, a fight status, an occupation, shillings, and a societal status. This program uses basic progamming structures.


### 🚀 Usage

Step 1: make sure python is installed
Step 2: open the file name "NPC_generate.py"
Step 3: Enter at least 10 names into the terminal
Step 4: Watch as your characters generate
Step 5: Run as many times as needed

Example output: 
Character: ['Sarah']
Shillings: 16.9
Occupation: Weaver
Can they fight? No
Traits: gentle, proud, and prideful
Societal status: Peasantry
